## Project overview 

This repository is made with the intention of having a location where to store all the useful commands, functions and best practices that can be helpful when bioinformaticing. The content of this repository is created for alleviatiang the stress one typically faces when working with any amount of data as it will provide solutions and best-practices not only for data analysis, but especially for data handling and storing. <br/>

This repository should be updated regularly and/or each time we come across with new useful solutions for a given computational problem that could benefit others. Links pointing to StackOverflow threads, IT supporting documentations etc are provided within each file whenever relevant.

**NB:** while most of the commands that will be listed in this repository can be used in any operating system, others have been tested/executed on the WEHI's high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, ie Milton, so they might have different names in other systems. This can be particularly relevant when it comes to best practices on how to install and run softwares. </br>

## Content
This repository contains a list of markdown files that are all located within the `docs` folder.  Since the infinite number of commands, functions etc.. that exist actually poses a treat to the usefulness of this repository (they risk of creating a mess and/or endless documents that no one will ever read), for each task (or topic) there is a file containing all those useful commands we should keep in mind when performing that given task.
